# Recognition-of-hand-drawing-shapes
Using CNN ( Convolutional Neual Networks ) on recognition of hang drawing shapes.

Using train.py you can create your own model and save. After that you will train your model with datas you can test. I also shared with you my test.py

Model.pb is for using model on Android Studio and converter.py is for converting Keras model to Tensorflow.

With enlarging dataset, you can use CNN for all hand draws (0..9,A..Z, shapes, ...). Also you can use my codes for making your own model with any datas onyl by making some changes at train.py
